I am self taught in C programming and have been using 📖 The C Programming Language 2nd edition by K&R for my reference. I found this to be a very effective book to 👨‍🎓 learn from and recommend to anyone looking to learn the C language. The exercise problems are very important to better your understanding of concepts, so attempt them yourselves. Make sure to type 💻 your code, not copy and paste. This is beneficial, since you learn syntax better this way.
